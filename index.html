                            <strong>Smart Weather Monitoring System Using NodeMCU</strong><br>
                            This project uses the NodeMCU ESP8266 with sensors like DHT11, LDR, rain sensor, and MQ6 to monitor temperature, humidity, light, rainfall, and gas levels. Designed for agriculture, it sends real-time data to the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and can trigger actions like activating a water pump or moving a cover. It offers a low-cost, efficient solution for precision farming, smart irrigation, and home automation using the Arduino IDE.

                            I developed a machine learning-based project to predict loan amounts using a structured dataset. The system involved thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the application of various ML algorithms to ensure accurate and reliable predictions. This project helped me deepen my understanding of data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation in real-world financial scenarios.

                            <strong>Smart Parking Assistant Using Arduino</strong><br>
                            This project is a smart parking assistant system built using an Arduino, IR sensors, a relay module, and a servo motor. The IR sensors detect the presence of a vehicle in the parking space. When a car is detected, the servo motor automatically lifts a barrier or gate, and the relay can be used to control additional functions like lights or indicators. This compact and efficient setup helps manage parking spaces automatically, reducing the need for manual intervention and enhancing vehicle flow and space utilization.

                            Earthquake Detection System Using Arduino Nano
                        This earthquake detection system uses an Arduino Nano, an accelerometer (ADXL335/ADXL345), an LCD display, and a buzzer to monitor seismic activity. The accelerometer detects vibrations, and when they exceed a predefined threshold, the system activates the buzzer for an audible alert and displays real-time vibration data on the LCD screen. This project provides a simple and effective early warning mechanism, showcasing how microcontrollers and sensors can be used for safety and disaster preparedness.

                            This project focuses on early detection of brain blood clots using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). It uses the MAX86150 sensor to monitor oxygen levels in brain tissue, with data wirelessly transmitted via ESP8266 and analyzed in MATLAB. By visualizing oxygen variations through heatmaps, the system can help identify potential clot formations. The project combines sensor interfacing, wireless communication, and signal processing, offering a non-invasive, real-time solution with potential for stroke prevention and medical applications.
